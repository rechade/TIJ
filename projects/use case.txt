tij proxy transaction system
===============================
High Level Description
Actors: user, system
User enters up to three transactions on terminal command line
the input is interpreted and if it's valid 
the system tries to execute it.
if there's an exception while trying, any changes are rolled back and the user is
informed of what failed. Otherwise the changes are committed
eg. commands are to append text to local text files.

assume in the normal case, files will always be in a state that can be rolled back (no other users
will have modified the files in a way that this program cannot roll back its
transactions, although the files may be open or unusable in some other way)

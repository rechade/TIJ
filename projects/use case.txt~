tij proxy transaction system
user enters a transaction on terminal command line
the input is interpreted and if it's valid 
the system tries to execute it.
if there's an exception while trying, any changes are rolled back and the user is
informed of what failed. Otherwise the changes are committed
eg. commands are to append text to local text files.
